This project is a fun implementation of Neural Network's-

- Optim class -- Optimizer
- Model class -- Neural Network model
- MLOPS -- Operators required for Deep learning, like Sigmoid, ReLU etc

The goal is learning the under-the-hood working of neurons.

Libraries used-
 - Numpy
 - Pytorch's Tensor, only for calculating Gradient
 - tqdm

A much later goal in this project-
 - remove pytorch dependency


Here is a [demo training mnist dataset](https://github.com/akash5100/nn/blob/main/nn/demo.ipynb)
